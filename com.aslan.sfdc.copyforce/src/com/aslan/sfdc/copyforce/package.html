Copy schema and data from Salesforce to another database (See concrete classes for specific database support).
<p>
CopyForce is the root package for all concrete classes that introspect Salesforce and copy schema and data to another database.
The base class, {@link com.aslan.sfdc.copyforce.CopyForce}, defines the command line switches/options supported by all concrete implementations.
A concrete typically only adds additional options for connecting to a particular database.
